			<h3>Blog Post One</h3>
			<small>Posted by Brad on July 17</small>
			<p>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
			Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
			Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
			And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;
			Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
			And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
			And every fair from fair sometime declines,
			By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;
			But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
			Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
			Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
			When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:
   			So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
   			So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>
